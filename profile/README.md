**The UOR Foundation**

The UOR Foundation is dedicated to developing universal data standards for semantic web, open science and frontier technologies.

---

**Getting Started**

PRISM, developed by the UOR Foundation, is an open source, formal, machine readable framework for structuring, encoding, and mathematically verifying knowledge. It provides a universal coordinate system for information, where structures are derived, encoded, and validated against explicit rules.

At its core is the Universal Lossless Encoder, a canonical method for presenting arbitrary information on a finite topological space. Any dataset, model, or theory can be encoded into a finite structured form with well defined relations, enabling deterministic validation, structural consistency checks, and reproducible verification.

**What it enables**
- Canonical, lossless encoding of arbitrary information
- Schema level and rule based mathematical verification
- Reproducible, machine checkable structures
- Cross domain interoperability through a shared formal language

**How to start**
1. Visit the [PRISM repository](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/prism)
2. Read the README to understand the architecture and verification model.
3. Review the schema and graph definitions to see how structures are formally derived and constrained.
4. Fork the repository and begin encoding or validating your own models.

*Build with it. Verify with it. Extend it.*
